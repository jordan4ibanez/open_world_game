# open_world_game
 This is a simple test for the nim programming language.

I wanted to see if it's remotely feasible for me to make a game in nim.

What you're seeing is that test.

Probably works on your OS, I think?

The premise:

I'm basically just making it for the sake of making it.

Literally no intention, the only baseline idea is: 2d, top down, open world, survival.

Literally no art style, no play style, no cares given.

OpenSuse required packages:
```
# this needs to be double checked in a VM
sudo zypper install libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXext-devel libXinerama-devel libXi-devel Mesa-libGL-devel libXxf86vm-devel alsa-devel
```
